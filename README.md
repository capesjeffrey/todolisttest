# As instructed:

1. All necessary files uploaded to GITHUB.
2. Download the project.zip file, extract it and open the README.md file. You will find the links added to to the bottom of the file. (this was a bit unclear - I therefore followed it to the T)
3. Please also find the test plan (task1.md) in the tests repository of the project.

# Files:

- Task 1.md is the test plan.
- Task 2.md contains all the bugs identified.
- testevidence.rar is all bug test evidence.
